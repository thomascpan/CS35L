and restart with "disable driver signature enforcement."

Reinstall Windows 64-bit driver. This time succeeded.

$ ssh -X thomasp@192.168.43.186
$ ssh-keygen

$ touch test.txt

SSH onto partner(s) beaglebones with password and with X11 forwarding.
Create public-private key pair. Pass public key to server. SSH onto partner(s) beaglebones without password and with X11 forwarding.
